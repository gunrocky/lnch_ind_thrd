 * Running independent threads: Write a program that
 * 1. Launches *N* independent threads of execution and
 *    waits for the completion of execution of all threads
 *    (let *N* be specified as a command line parameter for launching the program).
 * 2. Let each of the threads a fixed number of times in a loop,
 *    only indicate itself with a letter or number (different for each thread)
 *    in the common indication line, and perform the shortest passive delay each loop
 *    (to allow others to work as well).
 * 3. Ensure that threads begin active execution loops not immediately
 *    at the moment of creation of each of them,
 *    but simultaneously after the creation of the last of *N* threads.
 * 4. Before the program terminates, print an indication line showing the sequence of threads.
